Once conceled, text will not rewrap.

See https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/260. Might be fixed by NeoVIM soonish with their "anticonceal" project.

I'm never not going to be able to install my `~/.dotfiles`. I will not fear that I have developed muscle memory around key remappings. The only time I'm going to be bound is when I'm on an embedded device or a strange server, and I won't be using `tmux` and `zsh`. Only `vi` needs to remain the way that it is, since it is the one true universal. `zsh` shouldn't remap the `sh` fundamentals. In foreign environments it will be the `vi` and whatever `sh` they give me.
